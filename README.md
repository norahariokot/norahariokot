<p>I am a backend software developer who recently transitioned from a career in accounting. My fascination with web applications and how they function ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù sparked my interest in programming. From sending emails to streaming videos, my curiosity about the technology driving these features led me to explore coding.</p
                                                                                                                                                                                           
<p>My coding journey began with a simple curiosity about how static web pages were built. Once I learned to build these, I explored further and my curiosity transformed into passion leading me to opt for backend development. I enjoy bringing ideas to life and solving problems through programming logic and I have been honing my skills by building personal projects and continually expanding my knowledge. My current technical stack includes Python, C, Flask, JavaScript, and SQLite for database management. </p>

<p>I am currently seeking a role in backend web development, ideally focusing on Python, but I am open to learning new technologies. If you're hiring or looking to collaborate on exciting projects, let‚Äôs chat! I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and contributing to innovative solutions that drive impact in the tech community.</p>
