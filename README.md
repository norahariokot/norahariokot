<p>I am a backend software developer who recently transitioned from a career in accounting. My fascination with web applications and how they function ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù sparked my interest in programming. From sending emails to streaming videos, my curiosity about the technology driving these features led me to explore coding.</p
                                                                                                                                                                                           
<p>My coding journey began with a simple curiosity about how static web pages were built. As I explored and learned more, this curiosity transformed into a deep interest, pushing me to develop fully-fledged web applications. I chose to specialize in backend development because I enjoy bringing ideas to life and solving problems through programming logic.
To strengthen my expertise, I have been actively building personal projects and continually expanding my knowledge. I am committed to growth and learning, always aiming to enhance my skills and take on new challenges. Currently, my technical skillset includes Python, C, Flask, JavaScript, and SQLite for database management.
</p>

<p>I am currently seeking a role in backend web development, ideally writing Python, but I am always open to learning new tech stacks. If you're hiring or looking to collaborate on exciting projects, let‚Äôs chat! I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and contributing to innovative solutions that drive impact in the tech community.</p>
